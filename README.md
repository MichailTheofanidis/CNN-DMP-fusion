# Unreal-PR2-Data-Generator

PR2 simulator using the Unreal Engine. 

The code also generates a dataset that contains grasping attempts with the PR2 robot.

The dataset contains image sequences of the PR2 robot as it tries to grab random kitchen objects. 
The equivalent joint trajectory and the dmp parameters of the grasping attempt are also captured.
